# Sorting Visualization
A Java program that provides a visualization of multiple sorting algorithms. The visualization uses an array of 100 elements. Each element is represented as a bar in the visualization, with the taller bars being larger numbers. When the array is sorted, it will be sorted from least to greatest, and make a staircase type of shape.

# Supported Algorithms
My sorting visualization currently supports the following algorithms:
* Bubble Sort
* Merge Sort
* Quick Sort
* Selection Sort
* Insertion Sort

# How to use
To run the visualization, just select the algorithm you want from the drop down and press the start button. You can also randomize the array using the randomize button, this is good for resetting the array to use a different algorithm on it.

# Technologies Used
* Java
